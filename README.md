## Interest Rate Calculation

The interest rate for a credit card that depends on the time (in months) the user is going to pay can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

Where:
- \( I \) is the interest amount
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount of money)
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal)
- \( t \) is the time in months# CleanCode

## Monthly Payment Calculation

To calculate the monthly payment for a credit card, you can use the following formula:

\[ M = \frac{(1 + r)^t - 1} \]
{P \times r \times (1 + r)^t}
Where:
- \( M \) is the monthly payment
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount of money)
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (as a decimal)
- \( t \) is the time in months
